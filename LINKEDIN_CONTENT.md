**Title:** Building a Cloud-Native Banking Microservices System 🚀

**Description:**

I'm excited to share my latest project: a comprehensive **Banking Microservices Application** built with **Java 21** and **Spring Boot 3.2**. This project simulates a real-world financial system, focusing on scalability, resilience, and modern cloud-native patterns.

🔹 **Architecture:**
Designed a distributed system using the **Microservices** pattern, decomposing complex banking logic into independent services (Accounts, Loans, Cards) orchestrated via **Docker Compose** and **Kubernetes**.

🔹 **Key Technologies Investigated:**
*   **Spring Cloud Ecosystem:** Leveraged **Config Server** for centralized configuration, **Netflix Eureka** for service discovery, and **Spring Cloud Gateway** for intelligent routing and security.
*   **Event-Driven Architecture:** Implemented asynchronous communication between services using **Apache Kafka** and **Spring Cloud Stream**, ensuring decoupled and scalable interactions.
*   **Resiliency:** Integrated **Resilience4j** to implement Circuit Breaker, Retry, and Rate Limiter patterns, making the system robust against failures.
*   **Security:** Secured APIs using **Keycloak** (OAuth2/OIDC) acting as an Authorization Server, enforcing strict access controls.
*   **Observability (LGTM Stack):** Implemented a full observability suite using **Grafana**, **Loki** (Logs), **Tempo** (Tracing), and **Prometheus** (Metrics) with **OpenTelemetry** auto-instrumentation for deep insights into system performance.
*   **DevOps:** Automated containerization with **Jib** and managed deployments using **Helm Charts** for Kubernetes environments.

This project was a deep dive into building production-ready distributed systems, tackling challenges like distributed tracing, consistency, and fault tolerance.
